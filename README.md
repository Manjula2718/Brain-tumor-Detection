# Brain-tumor-Detection
brain tumor segmentation on MRI scans using MATLAB, applying advanced image processing techniques like thresholding, clustering, and machine learning. Utilized MATLAB's toolbox to enhance accuracy in isolating tumor regions. This segmentation improves diagnostic precision and supports treatment planning.
